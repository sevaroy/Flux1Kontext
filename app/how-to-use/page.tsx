              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                After uploading the image, you will enter the chat interface. In
                the chatbox, clearly describe the edits you want to make to the
                image. For example: &quot;Please blur the background.&quot; &quot;Change the
                red car in the picture to blue.&quot; &quot;Add a pair of sunglasses to
                this person.&quot;

                Tip: The more specific your description, the more accurately AI
                can understand your intent. You can try different ways of
                phrasing.
